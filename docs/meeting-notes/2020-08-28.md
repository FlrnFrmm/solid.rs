### Team Introduction
A smal indroduction about each member

#### [huhn511](https://github.com/huhn511)
My name is Sebastian, i'm a software developer and project manager. Started my coding career with Java while study, later I became a professional Ruby On Rails developer. In the meantime, I build some microservices with pure Javascript (nodejs). I get deeper into IoT and the Next Web, so i decided to learn Rust. Currently working on Decentralized Identities (DID) and working in a data exchange platform startup.
#### [Florian Fromm](https://github.com/flrnfrmm)
Hi! My name is Florian Fromm, I'm from germany and I work as a Cloud- & DevOps-Consultant for a small consultancy. Furthermore I'm also a big Rust enthusiast, therefore I organise a local Rust meetup and that is also where I met Sebastian. He told me about SOLID and I was immediately interested. Besides that I had for a long time the eager wish to contribute something to Open Source, so why not try to contribute to SOLID rust? 
## SOLID Implementations
There are many implementations of SOLID:

- [node-solid-server](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server)
    - Solid server on top of the file-system in NodeJS
    - 2977 commits 
- [community-server](https://github.com/solid/community-server)
    - Implementation of the Solid server.
    - 65 Commits (very new)


### Current Status of [solid-rust](https://github.com/JordanShurmer/solid-rust)
- Tokio vs async-std
    - solid-rust uses Tokio, we would like to use the [async-std](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std)
- [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) probably to low level
    - [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) could be better
    - or [Actix](https://github.com/actix/actix) or [Actix web](https://crates.io/crates/actix-web)
- Build own [LDP](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) as extra crate 
    - [zbox](https://github.com/zboxfs/zbox): Zero-details, privacy-focused in-app file system.


### Server Architecture
- [Solid server ‚Äì Selected architectural diagrams v1.3.0](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/solid-server-architecture/solid-architecture-v1-3-0.pdf)
- [HTTP request handling flow](https://github.com/solid/solid-architecture/blob/master/server/request-flow.md)



### Collect reading ressources

- [Specification: The Solid Ecosystem](https://solid.github.io/specification/)
- [Paradigm shifts for the decentralized Web](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/)

### Proposal: Working Group with [#OMA](https://openmarketplace.org/)
This project is a nice pilot project. The community contains many developers, designers and thinkers. 

Goals of the WG: 
- Tell and teach about SOLID
- Build the base for a privacy protected eCommerce Platform
