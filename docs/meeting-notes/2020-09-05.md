### Questions

Q: Do we have a frontend? (Data Browser, Data Profile Page, Login, Contact List, ...)
A: Would be nice. 


### Example Applications / Use Cases

- Data Wallet for #OMA
    - Browser tracks customer user data (which product, how long, etc..)
    - These data are just stored on user device
    - Data can be sold by the user
- User Management FabLab Saar
    - Combinable with [identity.rs](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs)
