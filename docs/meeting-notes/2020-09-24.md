## üí¨ Discussion topics
- Solid as library
- Refactor Structure
- Error Handling
- ldp

### Solid as library
- Discover with Tensor, how to implement this
- Would be nice, that peolpe can choose actix-web, iron, rocket, warp or something else as their server framework
- Could be implemented as trait (route trait)

### Refactor Structure
- solid_storage should be used by solid_ldp.
- solid_server should use solid_ldp instead.

### Error Handling
- implement own errors for ldp
- other creates already has some good errors (storage = zbox)
- use anyhow for propper errors

Example:
```rust
use anyhow::Result as AnyhowResult;
use thiserror::Error as DeriveError;

/// The main crate Error type; uses `thiserror`.
#[derive(Debug, DeriveError)]
pub enum Error {
    /// Error identity_core
    #[error("Identity_core Error: {0}")]
    IdentityCoreError(#[from] identity_core::Error),
    /// Error base64
    #[error("Base64 Error: {0}")]
    Base64DecodeError(#[from] base64::DecodeError),
}

/// The main crate result type derived from the `anyhow::Result` type.
pub type Result<T> = AnyhowResult<T, Error>;
```
